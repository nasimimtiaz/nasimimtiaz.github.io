<h2 id="content">About Me</h2>
										<p style="text-align:justify">Nasim is a third-year doctoral student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State), under the advisement of Dr. Swaroop Ghosh. Nasim received his Bachelors from the department of Electrical Engineering of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), 2014. Before starting Ph.D, Nasim was a lecturer in the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Daffodil International University, Bangladesh and before that we worked as an Associate Maintenance Professional in Halliburton, Bangladesh. His research interests include hardware security and low-power circuit design. Currently, he is exploring the security and privacy aspects of emerging non-volatile memories like STTRAM, MRAM and RRAM for cryptographic application. He is a student member of IEEE.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In 2017-2018 and 2016-2017 academic year, Nasim received Milton and Albertha Langdon Memorial Graduate Fellowship to support his graduate studies. He also received Richard Newton Young Fellow award (DAC, 2016), Dean’s List Award (BUET), University Merit Scholarship (BUET), Admission Test Excellency Scholarship (BUET) and Luna Worldwide Award (NASA, 2013). He was awarded the Best Presenter Award in IEEE International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Visions (ICIEV, 2013). As a volunteer, Nasim worked for IEEE Power Energy Society (PES) to develop an open source design of an efficient solar charge controller, 2013 and for SHIKKHA, a voluntary organization working for the betterment of education system in Bangladesh. His hobbies include travelling adventurous places, reading novels and playing strategic games.
